## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS
- Flexbox

### What I learned

This is my very first end-to-end web development project! 
It helped to go through the steps that I didn't experience while learning:
- Creating a project in VSCode
- Writing all the code from scratch
- Commiting the result to the GitHub

### Continued development

This is my very first project. So I feel it is still a bit chaotic, not very reusable or semantic. In the future I hope to focus on extending my knowledge in HTML and CSS to be able to write more organized and semantic code.
